# Hypothyroidism_Disease
Using Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines to Build a model that determines whether or not a patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism or not.

1.Defining the Question


a) Specifying the Question


As a Data Scientist, I have been recruited to work for Nairobi Hospital which is a private hospital in Kenya. I have been tasked to create a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism or not.

b) Defining the Metric for Success



This project will be successful when:

1)We Identify the most crucial independent variables that affect Hypothyroidism.

2)Have the lowest RMSE score possible

3)The model achieves atleast 80% accuracy

c) Understanding the Context



The thyroid gland is an organ located in the base of your neck; it is a butterfly-shaped. It releases hormones that control metabolism:

The endocrine system, which is made up of glands that produce, store, and release significant hormones into the bloodstream in order to enable hormones to reach the body's cells. The thyroid is part of the endocrine system and it gets iodine from the foods we eat and uses it to make two main hormones:

Triiodothyronine (T3)
Thyroxine (T4) It is so important that T3 and T4 levels are in regular level (neither too high nor too low). Two glands in the brainâ€”the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland communicate to maintain T3 and T4 balance. The hypothalamus produces TSH Releasing Hormone (TRH) that sends signals the pituitary to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more or less amount of T3 and T4 by increasing or decreasing the release of (TSH) thyroid stimulating
If T3 and T4 levels are low in the blood, the pituitary gland releases more TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones.
When T3 and T4 levels are high, the pituitary gland releases less TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to slow production of these hormones.
We are going to analyse factors that risk chances for Hypothyroidism

One being a woman

Age - older than 60

Genes - a family history of thyroid disease

Have an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease

Have been treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications

Received radiation to your neck or upper chest

Have had thyroid surgery (partial thyroidectomy)

Have been pregnant or delivered a baby within the past six months

d) Recording the Experimental Design



Data set is collected from repository data which consists of records of thyroid patients. Thyroid data set consists of both boolean or contiunous valued variables.

The project was undertaken using the following design Datasets(hypothyroid.csv)

Exploratory Data Analysis

Data Cleaning

Univariate Analysis

Bivariate Analysis

Multivariate Analysis

Modelling

Decision Trees: Random Forests , Ada Boosted Trees , Gradient Boosted Trees

Support Vector Machines: Kernel = polynomial , linear , rbf

Conclusion

e) Data Relevance




The relavance of our data will be answered by the following questions.

How accurate is the data at predicting whether a patient has hypothyroidism or not?

Was the dataset sufficient?

Was the data biased?

Is the data source a reliable source?
